## Real-Time, Time-Sensitive, and Explainable Stock Price Prediction using BERT for Financial Text Analysis
### Objective: 
The aim is to modify the BERT architecture to improve its performance on real-time, time-sensitive stock price prediction tasks using financial texts, and to provide explainability for the predictions.
### Methodology:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a large dataset of financial texts and corresponding stock price movements. Preprocess the data to make it suitable for BERT and to create a binary classification task (up or down).
2. BERT Modification for Time-Sensitive Analysis: Modify the BERT architecture to better handle time-sensitive analysis. This could involve using time-series analysis techniques or adding an additional layer specifically designed for time-sensitive tasks.
3. Training and Fine-tuning: Train the modified BERT on your dataset. Fine-tune the model parameters to optimize performance on the stock price prediction task.
4. Incorporating Explainability: Use techniques like attention mechanisms or methods like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to make your model more interpretable and explainable.
5. Real-Time Analysis: Design your model to work in real-time, analyzing financial texts and predicting stock price movements as soon as the texts are published. This would involve optimizing your model for speed and potentially using streaming data processing techniques.
6. Comparison with Traditional Methods: Compare the performance of your modified BERT with traditional methods for stock price prediction, such as linear regression, ARIMA models, etc. Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
7. Analysis: Analyze the results to understand where the modified BERT performs well and where it doesnâ€™t. Try to understand why these differences occur and how they could be addressed.
### Expected Outcomes: 
The research would lead to a novel application of BERT for real-time, time-sensitive stock price prediction tasks using financial texts and provide a comprehensive comparison with traditional methods. This could potentially highlight the strengths and weaknesses of using BERT for such tasks and pave the way for future research in this area.
